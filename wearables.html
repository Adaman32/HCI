          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>Coming into this challenge, I did not really have an idea where to even start the research, as I had trouble envisioning anything that could be translated into a nice challenge. However, after some googling, I found some interesting projects.</p>
          <h3 style="margin-top: 80px;"> Arm flamethrowers</h3>
          <p>This epic project was made by Allen Pan. The background is bringing the firebenders from Avatar: The last Airbender into reality and create flamethrowers that are activated by punches.</p>
          <img src="images/challenge2/flamethrowers.png" alt="">
          <p>I find this project really badass and entertaining. I can imagine that the flamethrowers must feel very empowering :D. This project is more for entertainment and fun purposes, rather than actual useful functionalities, but nevertheless, I really liked how seamlessly and effectively it works and how great it looks.</p>

          <h3>Hand washing timer</h3>
          <p> After the previous fun project, I decided to look into more useful projects, even if they would not be wearables. I found this cool hand washing timer, which during the coronavirus pandemic is very useful and helpful.</p>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEpfipV1_3w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>The timer was made by Lucas and Gautam from Google Creative Lab. It is fairly easy to assemble, and shows a timer of 20 seconds using Arduino, distance sensor and a servo motor. I really like that with such a project, you can very easily help mainly kids remember how important it is to wash your hands properly, and that this also shows that using Arduino, it is possible to creatively address and help with any current issues (such as now the corona crisis).</p>

          <h3> 3D printer status jacket</h3>
          <p>This project was made by Sally Kingston, or sallyhall - and is published on instructables circuits. It is a cool jacket with 40 LEDs that show the status of 40 3D printers in Dukeâ€™s Innovation Co-Lab Studio.</p>
          <img src="images/challenge2/jacket.jpg" alt="">
          <p>The LEDs are either red - when printer is offline, green - when printer is available or blue - when printer is printing. The status is being retrieved in real time wirelessly to the jacket. I think this project connects the cool part with useful - it can be used to monitor the status and immediately know when a printer is done printing without having to constantly check on it. I find it impressive that such a simple and small idea can be effectively implemented to simplify 3d printing work, while creating an interesting attraction in the process - if I was a customer in a 3D print shop, I would be pleasantly surprised and impressed.</p>

          <h2>Tinkering</h2>
          <p>I have completed the challenge - both Tinkering and Challenge part before the third Arduino workshop, so during my tinkering stage, I was just learning how to use the buttons.</p>
          <h3> Connecting proximity sensor and LED matrix</h3>

            <source src="videos/challenge2/tinkering1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
          <p>I was first just curious about whether I would be able to get the matrix work with the distance sensor. I set up four rings as patterns for the matrix, and using the distance sensor, I tinkered with them based on how far my hand was.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3> Using buttons</h3>
          <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="videos/challenge2/tinkering2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
          <p>I then used a similar set up, but I wanted to try out buttons. I hooked up two buttons to the breadboard, connected them to arduino, and gave each one of them a different ring to show when they are pressed.I sometimes encountered problems with the buttons, when they were loosely connected - they either did not respond, or responded without me pressing them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3> Buttons with speaker</h3>
          <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="videos/challenge2/tinkering3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
          <p>I really liked the possibilities of buttons, so I wanted to tinker with them more. Next up, I connected a piezo speaker to the Arduino, and gave it a tone to play. I thought of an idea of using different buttons for different tones in my challenge, and creating a wearable music instrument, but in the end I went into a different direction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h3>Tinkering with tones</h3>

            <source src="videos/challenge2/tinkering4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
          <p>As I said, I decided to do something different for my challenge, but I still wanted to explore tinkering with the speaker and buttons a bit more. I connected the distance sensor again, and used it to map out different tones based on the distance. The only problem is, that it is nearly impossible to create some pleasant music this way :D</p>

        <div class="section" style="margin-top: 150px;">
          <h2>Design and Build</h2>
          <h3>Snake</h3>
          <p>First, I found <a style="color: white;" href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arduino-bro/snake-led-matrix-game-1c7222">this project of Snake</a> and tried to implement it to my concept - I wanted to make a wearable Snake game. I changed the code quite significantly - changed it from using a joystick to two buttons - left/right, and made the snake advance automatically, I also at first eliminated game over, and set up that moving beyond the matrix will make the snake come out from the other side.</p>
          <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="videos/challenge2/snake.mp4" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
          <p> Next, aside from entertainment, I wanted to make something useful, especially in times of the corona crisis. I decided to accompany the snake game with a hand washing timer - using the LED matrix and a piezo buzzer. I also connected a potentiometer for selecting a functionality - snake or hand washing timer. I then used <a style="color: white;" href="https://xantorohara.github.io/led-matrix-editor/">this LED matrix editor</a> to create the numbers for the countdown and icons for the menu and countdown finish. Here you can see a diagram of how I set up the whole circuit: </p>
          <img src="images/challenge2/challenge1.png" alt="">
          <p>
           I then programmed the countdown and found a tune for the <a style="color: white;" href="https://dragaosemchama.com/en/2019/02/songs-for-arduino/">Starwars Cantina song</a> implemented that on the countdown finish, and programmed the menu. My aim here was to coin entertainment and usefulness in unison. Furthermore, I didnt want to make another hand-worn wearable, so I went with the silly concept of SnakePants, where the whole circuit rests in one leg of pants.</p>

           <p>
             I think the concept I created answers the challenge topic well - it is quite silly, but innovative - pants embedded with an interface that lets the user play one of the all-time classic games, while giving them a useful functionality of a countdown for washing hands. It shows that you don't have to follow the traditional route of wearables - putting it on your arm - and as an experiment works quite well.

          <h2>Reflect</h2>
          <h3>Wearables in general and my vision of wearables in the future</h3>
          <p>I personally am not a huge fan of wearables such as smart watches. I do not necessarily want to have screens attached to me at all times, as to me it seems like you never have a break from being connected. However, some screen-less, nagging-less wearables are great innovations, such as a <a style="color:white;" href="https://mclear.com">ring for payments</a>, which generally make life easier and more convenient. I do not see wearables becoming a major tech segment like laptops or smartphones, but I could be proved wrong. I just hope that there will be more diverse small useful gadgets such as the contactless payment ring, rather than smartwatches and fitness trackers.</p>

          <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">My final product</h3>
          <p>When starting to work on my challenge, I was not sure what I was going to come up with, but once I programmed the snake with the LED matrix I thought of a silly idea of embedding the product into pants - mainly because I wanted to do something different from an arm-mounted tech. I also wanted to include something more useful than the snake, which is why I opted for a countdown timer for washing  hands. At first, I was not sure if I would be able to make a wearable prototype, but then I found some old clothes that I could destroy and got to work with a pair of scissors, and my sewing skills. The result looked quite funky, but it is just a first prototype - in future versions of SnakePants, the tech would be less bulky and the pants would look better - those are the areas to improve with my wearable :D. Other than that, I also experienced some problems with connections - the buttons and some other components kept disconnectingwhen worn, but that was due to the bulkiness of the cables. I complemented the resulting wearable with an ad showcase with 80s synthwave theme, which I think really fit and sold the idea even better.

          <h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">My experience using this technology</h3>
          <p>
            I never worked with Arduino before, and found it really fun to expand from programming just applications, to programming circuits and wiring it up myself. On the other hand, I found it quite hard to create a wearable with the solderless breadboard and the universal-length jumper wires, as some components kept falling out or having bad connections. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed tinkering with the circuit, and figuring out how to wire everything and program the code to create my own gadgets - it gave me a feeling of achievement and showed that if I need some simple tech, I might as well build it myself.
